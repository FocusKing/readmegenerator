# <README Generator>

## Description

As a developer my task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. I reviewed the professional readme guide as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.
My motivation came from creating a program that utilizes the inquirer package but also have the potential to store our information very similar to local storage. 
I built this project to practice using installed application such as Inquirer to produce a professional README that allows other users to gather ideas that will help them produce an even better project.

## Installation
Our task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package, package,json, DS.Store and node modules. We do this by running npm install Inquirer inside of the terminal.



## Usage
The user will be presented with a series of questions pertaining to the README Generator created. The user will answer the questions accordingly and after doing so a new tab with responses should populate.  

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
