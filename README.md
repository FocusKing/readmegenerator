# <README Generator>


## Description

As a developer my task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. I reviewed the professional readme guide as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.
My motivation came from creating a program that utilizes the inquirer package but also have the potential to store our information very similar to local storage. 
I built this project to practice using installed application such as Inquirer to produce a professional README that allows other users to gather ideas that will help them produce an even better project.

## Installation
Our task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package, package,json, DS.Store and node modules. We do this by running npm install Inquirer inside of the terminal.



## Usage
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
The user will be presented with a series of questions pertaining to the README Generator created. The user will answer the questions accordingly and after doing so a new tab with responses should populate.  

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits
List your collaborators, I was fortunate enough to get additional assistance from class mates either during office hours or during private study group sessions after class. I truly appreciate any help that I have received throughout this project.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well. Below is the intial link used to create the respository by capturing information from the starter code.

## Tests

Great way to test the program is by using node index.js, review the terminal for any errors. You can also console log data to see how the program is running and what information is being pulled through.
